E-commerce Website Overview
The e-commerce website is a complete platform where a user can view, buy the products, and also manage the account. This website is designed using the MERN stack- MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js-which enables smooth and scalable front and back-end usage.
Front-end

Technologies used:
React.js for reusable UI components
React Router for client-side routing
Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend
Backend
The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js. It provides a robust and scalable platform for all the business logic, database interactions, and API endpoints.
Main features of the backend:

User Authentication: Deals with user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication for safe access to protected routes.

Product Management: Deals with adding, updating, and deleting products. Admins can update the inventory, prices, and descriptions of products.
Order Processing: Manages customer orders, including product details, shipping status, and payment information.
REST API: Exposes a set of RESTful endpoints for interacting with the frontend, including user authentication, product management, and order handling.
Technologies used:
Node.js for running the server-side logic.

Express.js to create and manage RESTful API routes.
MongoDB as the database to store users, products, and orders in a flexible document-based structure.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users and restrict access.
Thus, this architecture will ensure smooth, efficient, and secure access to the e-commerce platform both for users and admins.
