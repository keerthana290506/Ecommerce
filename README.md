Overview
This is the E-commerce Follow-Along Project. In this repository, you will find all the code and documentation you need to implement a fully functional e-commerce application using the MERN Stack, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. With this, you will be able to build a complete e-commerce system from scratch by following along.

???? Application Features
User Authentication: Secure registration and login system.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product details.
Order Handling: Seamlessly manage customer orders.
REST API Integration: Well-structured API endpoints for interaction with the system.
Database Schema Design: Efficient schema structure in MongoDB.
Role-Based Access: Ensure secure transactions with role-based access control.
????️ Core Concepts Covered
This project covers essential topics of the MERN Stack, including:

MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible schema design.
Express.js: Lightweight backend framework to build REST APIs.
React.js: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime for backend logic.
The project shows how the technologies could fit together as one cohesive e-commerce platform.

???? API Endpoints
The application exposes several API endpoints:

User Authentication
POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate an existing user.
Product Management
GET /api/products: Retrieve a list of all products.
POST /api/products: Add a new product.
PUT /api/products/:id: Update a product by ID.
DELETE /api/products/:id: Remove a product by ID.
Order Handling
GET /api/orders: Retrieve all orders.
POST /api/orders: Create a new order.
GET /api/orders/:id: Retrieve order details by ID.
???? Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v16+)
npm (or yarn as an alternative package manager)
MongoDB (v5+), either running locally or using a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-app.git
cd e-commerce-app
Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy
cd backend
npm install
Install Frontend Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend folder and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy
cd./frontend
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a.env file in the backend folder with the following content:

makefile
Copy
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=5000
Replace your-mongodb-connection-string with your MongoDB connection URI and your-secret-key with a secret key for JWT authentication.

Running the Application
Start the Backend

Navigate to the backend folder and start the server:

bash
Copy
cd backend
npm run dev
This will start the backend on http://localhost:5000.

Start the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend folder and start the React development server:

bash
Copy
cd./frontend
npm start
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

Access the Application
Open up your browser and access the frontend by navigating to http://localhost:3000. The backend can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
